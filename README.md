## 🧠 About Me

I build production-grade machine learning systems that operate at real-world scale.

Over the past 4+ years, I’ve engineered ML platforms across financial services, aviation, and telecommunications — including:

• Fraud detection systems processing 8,000+ transactions/second  
• Network anomaly detection serving 100M+ users  
• LLM-powered customer support systems handling 5M+ monthly interactions  
• Time-series forecasting models improving revenue by 8.3% across 400+ routes  

My focus is on translating advanced ML architectures into reliable, scalable, and business-critical systems.
