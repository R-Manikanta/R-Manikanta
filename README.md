## 🧠 About Me

AI/ML Engineer with 4+ years building and operating production machine learning systems across financial services, aviation, and telecommunications.

I work on systems that run at enterprise scale:

• Fraud detection processing **8,000+ transactions per second**  
• Network anomaly detection serving **100M+ customers**  
• LLM-powered systems handling **5M+ monthly interactions**  
• Revenue forecasting across **400+ global airline routes**

My focus is production AI — where scalability, latency, monitoring, and governance matter as much as model accuracy.
