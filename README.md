## Executive Profile

AI/ML Engineer with 4+ years designing and operating production machine learning systems across financial services, aviation, and telecommunications.

My work consistently operates at enterprise scale:

• Real-time fraud detection processing 8,000+ transactions per second  
• Network anomaly detection protecting 100M+ customers  
• LLM-powered support systems serving 5M+ interactions monthly  
• Revenue forecasting across 400+ global airline routes  

I specialize in building high-reliability ML platforms that integrate modeling, infrastructure, monitoring, and governance into cohesive production systems.
