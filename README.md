## Executive Overview

AI/ML Engineer with 4+ years building production machine learning systems in financial services, aviation, and telecommunications.

Experience operating ML at enterprise scale:

• Fraud detection processing 8,000+ transactions/second  
• Network anomaly detection serving 100M+ customers  
• LLM-powered systems handling 5M+ interactions/month  
• Forecasting systems improving revenue across 400+ airline routes  

I design ML systems where latency, scale, monitoring, and governance are as critical as model accuracy.
